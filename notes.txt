● TensorBoard Warning Fix

  The "TensorFlow installation not found" warning is normal - TensorBoard works fine without TensorFlow for PyTorch logs. You can ignore it or install TensorFlow if you want:

  pip install tensorflow

  How to See if it's Learning in TensorBoard

  Once you open http://localhost:6006, look for these key indicators of learning:

  Charts Tab:

  1. charts/episodic_return - Most important! This should trend upward over time
    - Good learning: starts low (negative/near zero) and increases
    - Bad: stays flat or decreases
  2. charts/SPS - Steps Per Second (performance metric)
    - Should be stable around 1000-3000+ SPS
  3. charts/explained_variance - How well the value function predicts returns
    - Good: approaches 0.8-0.95
    - Bad: stays near 0 or negative

  Losses Tab:

  1. losses/policy_loss - Should generally decrease over time
  2. losses/value_loss - Should decrease as critic learns
  3. losses/entropy - Should start high then decrease (exploration → exploitation)
  4. losses/clipfrac - Fraction of clipped policy updates (should be 0.1-0.3)

  What Good Learning Looks Like:

  - Episode returns start around -1 to 0, gradually increase toward +1
  - Value loss decreases from high initial values
  - Explained variance increases from ~0 to 0.8+
  - Entropy starts high (~1.0) and slowly decreases

  Red Flags:

  - Episode returns stay flat for >100k steps
  - Value loss increases or oscillates wildly
  - Explained variance stays negative
  - SPS drops significantly (memory issues)

  The script now has infinite timesteps (9.9B), so you can let it run and monitor these metrics to see learning progress!
